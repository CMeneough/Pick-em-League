# Pick-em-League
Statistical analysis of my weekly pick'em pool

I'm in a 37 person pool where we each pick 5 BCS teams against the spread every week. 

I was interested in how much better (or worse) the league performs than random (p=.5) guessing. 

I look at 2 different outcomes for each week of results.

First, how the total number of correct picks in the league compares to a distribution of random guessing.

Second, how the distribution of correct picks across the individuals in the league compares to the expected distribution under 50/50 guessing.
